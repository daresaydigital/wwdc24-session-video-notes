This document will list some of the [Session videos from WWDC 24](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2024) ([youtube alternative to videos](https://www.youtube.com/@AppleDeveloper/videos)) and our own summary and comment if it is a good watch, or what ever note we'd like to add.

## Meet Swift Testing
['Meet Swift Testing' session](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10179/) where they talk about the new testing for Swift! 

### Teddy's summary
It can now be used in Xcode too and exist together with XCTest. If we are using UIKit we should still use XCTest. As said, it's new so maybe not all the functions are there as XCTest and other frameworks from Apple has but I think it's an easy and good start for people like me who feels a bit unsecure and new when it comes to testing. Cool extra thing is it can be used where ever Swift can be used. 
Check it out! :)
